-- | An interface for creating MPD queries.
--
-- For example, to match any song where the value of artist is \"Foo\", we
-- use:
--
-- > Artist =? "Foo"
--
-- We can also compose queries, thus narrowing the search. For example, to
-- match any song where the value of artist is \"Foo\" and the value of album
-- is \"Bar\", we use:
--
-- > Artist =? "Foo" <&> Album =? "Bar"
